        <h2>About</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>I`m a photographer based in Nairobi who specializes in street Photography.
        <br>I grew up in the metropolitan area, Through my young age I disliked photos because I was unable to afford the professional side(In suits and studio photos).What I didnt know was that the streets which surrounded me would oone day be my studio. At the age of 16, I got lucky to meet a photographer, in our over populated area, who opened my eyes to the beauty around me. This encounter altered the path of my hate towards photos in was I couldn`t imagine
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Afer learning from the available matterials I had, I begarn my Photography journy through the help of my friends and family.
        <br>With the help i got from my friends and family, I have  received several awards.
